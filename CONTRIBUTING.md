# Contributing to KalshiSharp

Thanks for your interest in contributing to **KalshiSharp**!

KalshiSharp is an open-source, community-driven C# SDK for interacting with the Kalshi platform. Whether you’re fixing a typo, adding a feature, improving docs, or just kicking around ideas — contributions are always welcome.

This guide is intentionally lightweight. We’re optimizing for **momentum**, not ceremony.

## Ways to Contribute

All of these are valuable:

- Bug fixes
- New features or endpoints
- Documentation improvements
- Tests
- Suggestions and ideas
- Refactoring / cleanup

If you’re unsure whether something is “worth” contributing — it probably is.

## Issues First (When Possible)

For anything non-trivial, **opening an issue first is encouraged** (but not mandatory).

Opening an issue helps:
- Align on approach
- Avoid duplicated work
- Catch design concerns early

That said, small fixes and obvious improvements can go straight to a PR.

---

## Pull Requests

A good PR generally:
- Has a clear purpose (what & why)
- Is scoped to a single change or idea
- Builds and runs locally
- Follows existing patterns and style

You don’t need perfection — just clarity.

If something feels uncertain or debatable, call it out in the PR description.

---

## Development Notes

- This is a **C# / .NET** project
- Try to match existing naming, structure, and patterns
- If you add or change behavior, consider adding or updating tests
- Public API changes should be called out explicitly in the PR

If you’re unsure where something belongs, that’s totally fine — open a PR and we’ll figure it out together.

## AI-Assisted Contributions

Using AI tools (ChatGPT, Copilot, Claude, etc.) is totally fine! 👍

Just make sure that:
- You understand the code you’re submitting
- You’ve reviewed it for correctness and security
- You’re comfortable explaining or maintaining it

AI is an amazing force multiplier, not a substitute for ownership.

---

## Style & Philosophy

KalshiSharp aims to be:
- Idiomatic C#
- Predictable and explicit
- Easy to reason about
- Friendly to both hobbyists and serious users

When in doubt, favor **clarity over cleverness**.

---

## Questions?

If you’re unsure about anything:
- Open an issue
- Ask in a PR
- Or start with a draft PR and mark it as such

We’re happy to help and would rather guide than gatekeep.

Thanks again for contributing — and for helping make KalshiSharp better for everyone.
